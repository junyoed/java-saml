Basic java example of initiating a SAML authentication flow and consuming the resulting assertion.

=======================
BUILD / INSTALL / SETUP
=======================

1) You must have Maven 3 installed (Maven 2 might work, it's untested)

2) You need the DNS name demopartner.example.junyo.com to resolve to localhost.

3) You need to run this on port 8080.

4) Run

    mvn jetty:run

Which should start up the web server. The test page should then be available at

=======================
BUILD / INSTALL / SETUP
=======================

1) Download the required libraries (see below) and place them in lib/

2) Check src/jsp/index.jsp to make sure that the configuration strings will work for your test environment
	- demopartner.example.junyo.com is in public DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), you can change this or use a hosts 
	  file if you would like to test somewhere else.
	- your servlet container is assumed to be running on port 8080, change the port as needed.
	- do _not_ change the issuer string, even if you change the actual URLs used.
	
3) Build with ant

4) Deploy the WAR file

5) Happy testing!
